## Priority Gaps to Resolve

1. **[counterpoint needed]** — Find genuine opposition to Git for writers
   - Search: "why writers shouldn't use git" or "git not for everyone"
   - Check writing forums, Medium posts from skeptics

2. **[citation needed]** — "Creative flow" interruption argument
   - Look for cognitive science on task-switching during writing
   - Check writing process research

3. **[example needed]** — Concrete branching scenario
   - Draft a realistic example: "Chapter restructure experiment"
   - Could be hypothetical but plausible

## Lower Priority

4. **[citation needed]** — Diffs aiding self-review
   - May not find direct research; acceptable as [inference]

5. **[data unclear]** — CLI intimidation
   - Low priority; anecdotal evidence acceptable
