**User:** Let's explore why writers should use Git.

**Assistant:** Good topic. Framework is CTE. What's your core claim—why should writers care about version control?

---

**User:** Git belongs in every writer's toolkit. The same features that help programmers—history, branching, diffs—work for prose too.

**Assistant:** Strong claim. I've added it with [experience-based] tag since it's from your perspective. Who disagrees? What's the tension?

**User:** Most writers think Git is "programmer stuff." They keep folders of "draft_v2_FINAL.docx" and trust auto-save.

**Assistant:** Got it. Added to Tension. Is there a counterargument—someone who genuinely believes Git is wrong for writing?

**User:** Some say writing is non-linear and Git's commits force artificial structure. Creative flow shouldn't be interrupted.

**Assistant:** Added as counterpoint with [citation needed]. Now for Examination: what evidence supports your claim?

**User:** Every decision is recoverable—cut a paragraph, it's still in history. Branching lets you try risky restructures safely. Diffs show what actually changed.

**Assistant:** Added three supporting points. Tagged branching with [example needed] and diffs with [citation needed]. Any complicating factors?

**User:** gap check

**Assistant:** Scanning draft... Found 5 gaps:
- [counterpoint needed] — need stronger opposing view
- [citation needed] x2 — "creative flow" argument and diffs research
- [example needed] — branching scenario
- [data unclear] — CLI intimidation stats

Updated gaps.md. Status → Gap Check Needed.
