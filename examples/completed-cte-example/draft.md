# Benefits of Version Control for Writing

> Git isn't just for code—it's for anyone who revises.

**Framework:** CTE

## Claim

Version control (Git) belongs in every serious writer's toolkit. The same features that make it essential for software—history, branching, diffs—are equally valuable for prose. [experience-based]

## Tension

Most writers dismiss Git as "programmer stuff." They trust auto-save, keep folders of "draft_v2_FINAL_actually_final.docx" files, and lose track of what changed when. The learning curve feels unjustified for "just writing." [counterpoint needed]

**Counterpoint:** Some argue that writing is inherently non-linear and Git's commit model forces artificial structure. Creative flow shouldn't be interrupted by "saving checkpoints." [citation needed]

## Examination

### Supporting Evidence

- **Every decision is recoverable.** Cut a paragraph last week? It's still in the history. No more "I wish I hadn't deleted that." [experience-based]
- **Branching enables risky experiments.** Try a radical restructure on a branch. If it fails, delete the branch—original intact. [example needed]
- **Diffs show progress.** Comparing versions reveals what actually changed, not just that something changed. Useful for self-review. [citation needed]

### Complicating Factors

- Requires plain text (Markdown). Word docs don't diff well.
- Git's command-line interface is intimidating. [data unclear]
- Collaboration features (pull requests) are foreign to most writers.

### Explicit Gaps

- No hard data on writer adoption or productivity impact.
- Unclear if benefits justify setup for casual vs. serious writers.

## Implications

If version control works for writing, the "plain text movement" isn't just minimalism—it's about gaining capabilities that rich-text editors hide. Writers who adopt it may think more systematically about revision.

## Open Thread

- Would a Git GUI designed for writers improve adoption?
- Is Markdown the right format, or is there something better for prose?
- How do tools like Scrivener or Notion compare?
